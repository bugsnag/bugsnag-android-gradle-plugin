Bugsnag Android Gradle Plugin
=============================

This Gradle plugin automatically uploads [ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/proguard.html), [DexGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/dexguard) and NDK library mapping files, and sends build notifications to Bugsnag.

If you aren't using Gradle or need more manual control, [see the API docs](https://docs.bugsnag.com/api/android-mapping-upload/) for alternative ways to use Bugsnag with Proguard.

[Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com/platforms/android) for Android automatically detects crashes in your Android apps, collecting diagnostic information and immediately notifying your development team.
